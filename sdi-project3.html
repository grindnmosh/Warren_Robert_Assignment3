<p>There has been an epidemic of thefts at the school causing many students and parents to get very frustrated. No one has any idea who is doing it. You solved many mysteries at your last school and now just months into a new school you face a new mystery.  Are you up to the challenge? Every decision you make and every clue you discover will determine the path of your story.</p>
<p>First you ensure you have the tools you need, which would be your mini binoculars to start. You would want to ensure you were well hidden so were dark clothing. Once you arrive at school you would need to head to the gym and find your ideal hiding spot. This could lead to multiple choices. Also you know from past work having a partner helps but being new to this school you must decide whether you can trust Sam or if it is better to work on your own. And the story beginsâ€¦ </p>
<p>After a failed attempt in Part 1 you sat back with your friend Sam and made a plan. and now it's time to execute it.</p>
<p>So now we try again in part 3.</p>

<p>I chose this story due to thefts at my son's school which have impacted him as well as us. That combined with my joy of mysteries. I really enjoyed choose your path mysteries as a child.</p>
